    "It may look a bit complicated but donâ€™t worry, weâ€™ll unpack it, bit by bit. Letâ€™s start by looking at the three main components of a class code:\n",
    "\n",
    "**class Name()**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similarly to functions, classes are defined with a keyword. In this case it's `class`.\n",
    "- Afterwards, you write the class name preferably using *CamelCase* notation. This means that, differently to functions, you capitalize the first letter of each word and you don't use underscores to separate words. For example, `Person` and `PersonData` are correct according to [Python style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008). You can find out more about popular notation styles in this [article](https://betterprogramming.pub/string-case-styles-camel-pascal-snake-and-kebab-case-981407998841).\n",
    "- Finally, you add a pair of parentheses (`()`) and a colon (`:`) to end the line and begin a code block below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\_\\_init\\_\\_( )** to initialize your class\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions inside classes are called methods. In this example, you see that a method named `__init__()` is being defined inside the class, and it stands for *initialize*.\n",
    "```\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "        print(\"Class initialized.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This function is executed every time an **instance** of the class is created (also known as *instantiated*) and it can take arguments if desired. Use this place to assign values to properties of the class, or to execute other operations that are necessary every time an instance is created.\n",
    "- Notice that, differently from functions, you don't indicate the arguments inside the parentheses next to the class name. Instead, indicate the arguments inside the parentheses of the `__init__()`. You pass these arguments when you create an instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**self**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you read the code at the beginning, youâ€™ve seen that the word `self` appears in many places. What is it? `self` is a reference to the class instances you create and is used to access properties and methods inside the class. The important things to remember are:\n",
    "- When working inside of a class, always add `self`. before the name of properties. Do this when you **define properties** (like in `self.name = \"name\"`), and when you **call properties** (like in `return self.name`).\n",
    "- Always use `self` as the *first* argument when you **define methods** inside a class (like in `def set_name(self, name)`).\n",
    "- Never include `self` in the arguments when you **call methods** of a class (like in `self.print_new_name()`).\n",
    "- When interacting with an **instance** of a class, never use `self` to access its properties (like in `print(person_instance.name)`) or its methods (like in `print(person_instance.get_name())`). \n",
