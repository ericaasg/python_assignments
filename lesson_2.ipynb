    "As you write pen on paper in your notebook, your words flow through consecutive lines. Similarly, in Jupyter Notebooks, the code is written in consecutive cells, and sometimes the code in one cell depends on the code executed in a cell above. That’s why you need to make sure that every time you open a notebook you run every cell, and in the same order that they appear. Once you run a cell, you can go back to it, modify the code and run it again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to another critical aspect of Jupyter notebooks. If you use variables with the same name in different cells, the variable will always have the last value that you assign to it. For example, you may have a notebook with the code `price = 100; discount = 10` in cell 1, the code `final_price = price - discount` in cell 2, and the code `price = \"expensive\"` in cell 10. If you execute cell 1 and cell 2, you will get a correct result, but if you then execute cell 10 and then cell 2 again, you will get an error as you are telling Python to subtract a number from a string. What's even more dangerous, is if the code in cell 10 would have been `price = 200` instead of `price = \"expensive\"`. Because in this case it’s a number you wouldn’t get an error, but a wrong result, most probably without noticing! \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some tips to avoid these problems when you create your own notebooks:\n",
    "- Run all cells from top to bottom, don’t start running cells in the middle.\n",
    "- Don’t name different variables with the same name.\n",
    "- Only re-run a cell when you are sure this won’t assign it a value that will cause errors -or wrong results- in cells that you run afterward. \n"

    "Sometimes you want to repeat the same operations a number of times before other code instructions. In this case loops are fantastic.\n",
    "Imagine that you have an online shopping cart with 5 items and you want to know the total price. The website could use a loop to iterate over your items and add the price of each one to get the total price.\n",
    "There are two types of loops that you will be using: `while` loops and `for` loops.\n",
    "`while` loops are used when you want to execute code as long as a condition is true.\n",
